## Mobile Robot

This project involves a mobile robot that uses a distance sensor to create a map of its surroundings. As the robot moves through the environment, it collects distance measurements from obstacles around it. These measurements are then used to generate a map that represents the layout of objects and structures in the area.

Key Features:
- Map Creation: The robot, equipped with a distance sensor, records distance measurements while moving. This data is used to create an initial map of the area the robot has explored.

- Point Detection: Based on the collected data, the robot identifies key points in the space, which are then used to define the boundaries of the area.

- Border Drawing: In the post-processing phase, the point data is analyzed to draw the borders of the surrounding environment on the map. Statistical filtering and boundary estimation algorithms are used to accurately outline the area, providing a visual representation of the room or terrain.

This project combines advanced robotics technology and data processing to create an accurate depiction of the space, useful for applications such as autonomous robot navigation, spatial analysis, and environmental automation.
